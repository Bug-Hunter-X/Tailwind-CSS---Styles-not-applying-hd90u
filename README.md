# Tailwind CSS - Styles Not Applying

This repository demonstrates a common issue when using Tailwind CSS: styles not being applied to components.  The problem arises from an incorrect configuration of the `content` array in your Tailwind CSS configuration file.

## Problem

The included `bug.js` file contains a Tailwind CSS configuration where the `content` array doesn't correctly point to all the files containing Tailwind classes. This results in Tailwind ignoring the classes and not generating the necessary CSS.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file shows the correct configuration, ensuring that all relevant files are included.
